Basic FIFO Design
Serial ports can easily get overloaded with information letâ€™s build a FIFO to tackle that.

**I/O Ports of a FIFO**</br>
Our memories constrain much of our logic:</br>
Writes to the FIFO memory</br>
Reads from the FIFO memory</br>

**i_wr && !o_full**:  i_ data is written to FIFO</br>
**i_rd && !o_empty**: we will return o_data from the FIFO </br>

trick to the addresses...</br>
For a memory of 2^N elements</br>
With an N-bit array index</br>



Flaws in our design so far</br>
We broke our memory rules, not sure how :/</br>
always (*) o_data = fifo_mem[rd_addr];</br>

Logic also depends on wr_fifo and rd_fifo</br>
These values depend upon o_full and o_empty -> N bit subtract comparison </br>
This will limit the total speed of our design</br>

To be honest, I still am not able to get used to formal verification</br>
So will try simulating all kinds of possible cases to verify the FIFO</br>

Case 1: Write two arbitrary values to it in succession and prove that you can read those same values back later</br>
